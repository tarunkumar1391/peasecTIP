                    The capability type captures details of a Capability implemented by a malware instance.
                    A Capability corresponds to a high-level ability that a malware instance possesses, such as
                    persistence or anti-behavioral analysis. Malware Instances and Families may share Capabilities;
                    however, the associated Behaviors implementing the Capabilities will often differ. Therefore,
                    Capabilities are defined inline to Malware Instances and Malware Families rather than as top level
                    objects that are subsequently referenced.
