                        operating with malicious intent. A Threat Actor is not an Intrusion Set but may support or be
                        affiliated with various Intrusion Sets, groups, or organizations over time. Threat Actors leverage
                        their resources, and possibly the resources of an Intrusion Set, to conduct attacks and run
                        Campaigns against targets. Threat Actors can be characterized by their motives, capabilities,
                        goals, sophistication level, past activities, resources they have access to, and their role
                        in the organization. </p>

                                    Personal motivation, which is independent of the organizationâ€™s goals, describes what impels an
                                    individual to carry out an attack. Personal motivation may align with the organizationâ€™s motivationâ€”as
                                    is common with activistsâ€”but more often it supports personal goals. For example, an individual analyst
                                    may join a Data Miner corporation because his or her skills may align with the corporationâ€™s objectives.
                                    But the analyst most likely performs his or her daily work toward those objectives for personal reward
                                    in the form of a paycheck. The motivation of personal reward may be even stronger for Threat Actors who
                                    commit illegal acts, as it is more difficult for someone to cross that line purely for altruistic reasons.
                                    This is an open vocabulary and values SHOULD come from the attack-motivation-ov vocabulary.</td>
